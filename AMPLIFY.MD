### 3-1. Check src/aws-exports.js - below is an example
```
// WARNING: DO NOT EDIT. This file is automatically generated by AWS Amplify. It will be overwritten.

const awsmobile = {
    "aws_project_region": "ap-northeast-1",
    "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": "ap-northeast-1:abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-abcdefghijkl",
    "aws_cognito_region": "ap-northeast-1",
    "aws_user_pools_id": "ap-northeast-1_abcdefghi",
    "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": "abcdefghiabcdefghiabcdefgh",
    "oauth": {},
    "aws_user_files_s3_bucket": "s3-cognito-access-dev",
    "aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region": "ap-northeast-1"
};


export default awsmobile;
```

### 3-2. Edit src/aws-exports.js and create aws-exports.json
### Only use the json contents 
```
{
    "aws_project_region": "ap-northeast-1",
    "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": "ap-northeast-1:abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-abcdefghijkl",
    "aws_cognito_region": "ap-northeast-1",
    "aws_user_pools_id": "ap-northeast-1_abcdefghi",
    "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": "abcdefghiabcdefghiabcdefgh",
    "oauth": {},
    "aws_user_files_s3_bucket": "s3-cognito-access-dev",
    "aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region": "ap-northeast-1"
}
```
